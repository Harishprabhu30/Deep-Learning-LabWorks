    "Understanding the distribution and balance of classes within your dataset is a fundamental step that can significantly impact the performance and evaluation of your classifier.\n",

    "**Why Check Data Statistics?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Class Distribution Awareness: Knowing how many samples belong to each class (e.g., Cats and Dogs) helps in understanding the dataset's overall structure. If one class significantly outnumbers another, it can lead to biased models that favor the majority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring Balanced Evaluation: Particularly in the test set, class imbalance can skew the evaluation metrics. For instance, if 90% of your test data are Dogs and only 10% are Cats, a model could achieve 90% accuracy by always predicting \"Dog,\" without truly learning to distinguish between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusting Training Strategies: Awareness of class imbalance allows you to implement techniques like resampling, using class weights, or choosing appropriate evaluation metrics that account for imbalance (e.g., F1 score instead of accuracy).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance of Class Balance in the Test Set**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fair Performance Assessment: A balanced test set ensures that the model's performance is evaluated equally across all classes. This balance is crucial for a fair assessment of how well the model generalizes to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding Misleading Metrics: Imbalanced test sets can lead to misleading performance metrics. A model might appear to perform well overall but fail to correctly predict the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Preparation Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "To address potential class imbalance, especially when one class has more samples than another, we adjust the splitting percentages when creating the train and test sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculate Class Totals**: Determine the total number of images for each class to understand the extent of imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adjust Test Set Proportion**: Use a higher percentage of the minority class (Cats) and a lower percentage of the majority class (Dogs) to create a test set with an equal number of samples from each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proportional Distribution Among Breeds**: Within each class, distribute the test samples proportionally among the different breeds. This approach ensures that the test set represents the diversity within each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create Balanced Datasets**: By carefully adjusting the number of test samples from each class, we create balanced train and test datasets that lead to more reliable and interpretable evaluation results."
