1. Introduction

This experiment focuses on building an image classification system to distinguish between cats and dogs using transfer learning. Two pretrained architectures were used:

MobileNetV2

EfficientNet-B0

Both models were fine-tuned for 5 epochs on the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset, using a standardized training pipeline implemented in PyTorch. The objective was to compare their performance in terms of:

Accuracy

Precision / Recall / F1-score

Confusion matrix

Training time

Overall computational efficiency

All training logs, evaluation metrics, predictions, and summaries were automatically saved using our unified project structure.

6. Result Summary (Combined)

(Extracted from result_summary.py)

Model	Validation Accuracy	F1 Scores (Cats, Dogs)
EfficientNet	0.99729	Cats: 0.9958, Dogs: 0.9979
MobileNet	0.99323	Cats: 0.9896, Dogs: 0.9949

Key insight:
EfficientNet consistently outperforms MobileNet both in accuracy and F1-score despite longer training time.

7. Discussion

MobileNet performs well and trains faster, making it suitable for low-resource environments.

EfficientNet achieves near-perfect classification, with 1.00 test accuracy, showing superior representational power.

Both models show strong performance within only 5 epochs, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning for small datasets.

Confusion matrices indicate very few misclassifications, with EfficientNet producing the lowest error count.

8. Conclusion

This experiment successfully implemented and evaluated two pretrained models for cats vs dogs classification. With only minimal training (5 epochs), both models achieved high performance:

MobileNet: 99% accuracy

EfficientNet: 100% accuracy

EfficientNet is the best overall performer, while MobileNet offers faster training and efficiency. The project structure successfully automated training, evaluation, result saving, and summary generation, producing a clean and modular workflow.
