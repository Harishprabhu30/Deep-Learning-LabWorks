1. Introduction

Deep Dream is a computer vision technique that uses a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance and modify patterns within an image. By maximizing activations of selected layers in the network, the model generates dream-like, surreal hallucinations, often creating patterns resembling eyes, animals, or abstract shapes.

In this lab, we use GoogLeNet (Inception v1), a CNN with inception modules, which is particularly well-suited for Deep Dream due to its hierarchical representation of image features. The lab experiments explore the effect of different parameters, layers, and optimization settings on the generated images.

Key techniques explored:

Multi-scale (octaves) processing to enhance patterns at different resolutions

Jitter to prevent artifacts

Layer selection and weighting to control hallucination style

Total Variation (TV) loss to reduce high-frequency noise

2. Baseline Setup

The baseline pipeline consists of:

data_loader.py – loads images from a folder and converts them to tensors.

model.py – loads pretrained GoogLeNet, implements Deep Dream with multiscale and jitter, and calculates loss.

utils.py – contains helper functions such as deprocess, total_variation_loss, and jitter functions.

main.py – orchestrates the workflow: loads images, applies Deep Dream, saves output images, and plots loss curves.

Original image: [Insert image here]

Dreamed image: [Insert dreamed image here]

Loss graph: [Insert loss curve here]


4. Comparisons & Analysis

Iteration & layer weight: Higher iterations and stronger weights → more intense hallucinations; reducing them preserves original image.

Layer selection: Early layers produce texture-like patterns; later layers introduce structured, object-like features.

Octaves & octave scale: More octaves and higher scale → exaggerated effects; fewer octaves preserve color and shape.

Jitter: Reducing jitter stabilizes hallucinations and prevents artifacts.

TV loss: Ensures smooth patterns, reducing high-frequency noise.

The progression from Version 1 → Version 4 shows how tuning parameters can control hallucination intensity and preserve the original image, providing hands-on insight into Deep Dream mechanics.

5. Conclusion

Deep Dream can transform images from subtle texture enhancement to surreal, highly hallucinatory visuals.

Parameter tuning allows control over pattern intensity, original image preservation, and visual style.

Combining layers at different depths creates more visually appealing and structured hallucinations.

Final version demonstrates a subtle enhancement, preserving original image colors while adding artistic patterns.

This lab provides practical experience with pretrained CNNs, feature visualization, and neural network interpretability.
